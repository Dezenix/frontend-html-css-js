            <p>We are on a mission to make things easy and convenient for all the users who just want to save their
                time. This repository consists of all the development components that are being used while coding an end
                to end website along with fully coded components in HTML, CSS and JS. The main goal is to save your time
                by providing the complete code snippet with a fully responsive design of all the components that you may
                use in your development journey.</p>
